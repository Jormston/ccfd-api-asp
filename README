MaxMind minFraud API Version 1.2.5

=======
Example

See Example.asp for complete example how to use this API.
This script can be run from the shell.

=================
API Documentation

set ccfs = new CreditCardFraudDetection
  This creates a new CreditCardFraudDetection object
  Note: "Set" is required since it is an object

ccfs.isSecure
  If isSecure is set to 0 then it uses regular HTTP.
  If isSecure is set to 1 then it uses Secure HTTPS.

ccfs.input(dictionary)
  Takes a dictionary object and uses it as input for the server.
  See http://www.maxmind.com/app/ccv for details on input fields.

ccfs.query()
  Queries the server with the fields passed to the input method
  and stores the output.

set dictionary = ccfs.output()
  Returns the output from the server as a dictionary object.
  Note: "Set" is required since it is an object
  See http://www.maxmind.com/app/ccv for details on output fields.
  See http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/script56/html/jsobjdictionary.asp for details on Dictionary Objects

============
Secure HTTPS

This script uses Microsoft's Msxml2.ServerXMLHTTP which has full support for
https.  Most windows server should have it installed, but if for some reason your server
does not, then you will need to download and install the Microsoft XML Parser, the current
version at the time of this writing is 3.0 SP4.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/XML/XMLDownloads/default.aspx

Secure HTTPS is on by default.
If you do not wish to use Secure connections
then you can turn off Secure HTTPS by setting:

ccfs.isSecure = 0

where ccfs is the CreditCardFraudDetection object.

==============
Error Handling

The original PHP API really didn't handle errors very well, it just printed out the error and then halted the script, this would create all kinds
of problems in a production application, to resolve this issue I've added in some addtional code which will place any error messages into a string
value in the output dictionary object which can then be checked before processing the returned data.

Example:
	Dim ret
	Set ret = ccfs.output()
	if(ret.Item("err") <> "") then
		'handle error here
	else
		'Process data
	end if


A quick way to test the error handler is to modify the hostlist (Unable to find host), webservice url (404 file not found or Invalid data returned),
or set the timeout (Connection timed out) to a very low value (i.e. 0.01 seconds).
